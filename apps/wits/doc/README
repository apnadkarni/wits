What is WiTS
------------

Windows Inspection Tool Set slices a running Windows system
multiple ways, providing cross-linked, filtered views of
Windows components.

- Navigate easily across processes, network connections,
  users, services and more, via richly cross-linked views

- Focus on specific items through flexible filtering capabilities

- Customize displayed information and layouts to focus on
  areas of interest.

- Track and monitor resources and system activity such as
  process startup, network connections, logins and more with
  optional recording to disk

- Integrated view of Windows event logs with filtering/search


WiTS started out as a demo for TWAPI (http://twapi.sf.net) 
but is now an independent project on sourceforge.
